# Golf KC

A golf tee time aggregator for the Kansas City region.

## How it works

For golf courses and platforms that have open APIs it directly queries their APIs otherwise it scrapes their websites.

## What courses does it support?

You can find the full course list on the [website](https://golfkc.xyz) or in the [appsettings.json](./src/Web/appsettings.json) file.

## How can I request a new course be added?

If it has a public tee time sheet, you can file an issue and I'll try to get to it or you can open a PR.
